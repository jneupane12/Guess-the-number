# Guess-the-number
You have to guess a number and there are only limited number of guesses to find the correct number. If the correct number is less or greater than entered number, the program will display that the number is smaller or greater accordingly. The program will print total number of guesses it took to find the correct number and print "GAME OVER" message once the game is finished.
